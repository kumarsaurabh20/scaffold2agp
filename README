A ruby based interactive command line application to convert fasta formatted scaffold file(generated from CONTIGuator tool) to .agp file required for NCBI genome submissions. 

It requires a fasta file having scaffold(single scaffold assembled from mapped contigs) with gaps separating contigs. Gaps could be of fixed length or variable. The app also requires a CONTIGuator generated mapped contigs file for fetching +/- contig orientation information. 

Just initialize the init.rb(ruby init.rb) file and get your .agp file ready for NCBI submissions.

Contiguator output file has contig name in one column and contig length in other separated by a tab. Program automatically reads the file and extract orientation information. Just keep the file in the root folder. 

Currently the program only accepts single scaffold file. This limitation would be resolved in future versions of the program.

During execution, the program asks some user input for the .agp file requirements. Fill whatever information you would like to display in the .agp file. 

The last user input is the object_id (as explained in the NCBI .agp document). For single scaffold it will be same thoughout all contigs.
