A ruby based interactive command line application to convert fasta formatted scaffold file(generated from CONTIGuator
tool) to .agp file required for NCBI genome submissions. 

It requires a fasta file having a scaffold (single scaffold assembled from mapped contigs) having gaps which separates
contigs. Gaps could be of fixed length or variable. The app also requires a CONTIGuator mapped contigs file for fetching
+/- contig orientation information. 

Single scaffold limitation would be resolved in future versions of the program. 

Just initialize the init.rb file and get your .agp file ready for NCBI submissions.
